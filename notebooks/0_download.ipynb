The dataset consists of one day of data from eight broadband seismic stations with three components. The seismic stations are located in the North Anatolian fault zone.\n",

The download duration can change depending on your location, do not hesitate to consider another dataset that would suit you better. A more extensive tutorial about the mass downloader [is available in obspy's documentation](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.mass_downloader.html).\n",
